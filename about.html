            <div class="section-content typeset">
        <p>Just when the theoretical aspects of learning began to threaten practicality and the mundane routine began to jeopardize the charm of learning, our omniscient patrons presented us with an opportunity to indulge in practicality, break the code by thinking out of the box and making our lives almost as fast as light, well that was exaggeration but you know what it means. IMAZE, a technical fiesta was conceived in the year of 2002 and it stands still like a north pole showcasing its success year by year.</p>
                <p>
Welcome to IMAZE ’17, an extravaganza held at G H Patel College of Engineering &amp; Technology. It consists of a multitude of technical and non-technical events, scintillating workshops, intriguing seminars, mesmerising cultural events and fun on the spot games having alluring rewards to be won. As a package, it serves a perfect experience of combination of fun and presence of mind.

            <h2 class="section-title">GCET-CVM</h2>

            <div class="section-content typeset">
        <p>A self-financed institution, established in 1996, contributed to the growth of industries by providing dynamic youngsters with value based education. The private engineering college was set up as per the norms of the All India Council of Technical Education and the policy of the State Government. 
An eminent philanthropist, Shri Gordhanbhai Hathibhai Patel, made a generous donation of Rs. 3 crores for the new college. In honour of his magnanimous gesture, the college was named G H Patel College of Engineering & Technology, popularly known as GCET. 
</p>
              <p>  “If you dream, dream big”
quoted by the Iron Man of India, Late Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who inspired Shri Bhaikaka and Shri Bhikhabhai Saheb to create an institution as prodigious as CVM. Charotar Vidya Mandal (CVM) was established in 1945 as a charitable trust with the fundamental objective of development of rural India with the help of education. Awakening socialisation and enriching culture were the prime movers of an idea as tremendous as that of CVM. 
A task as magnificent as this is not as easy as the fall of apple by gravity. With the dedication and high sense of philanthropy of the founders it was possible to create what was in their vision. Over the years H. M. Patel consolidated the efforts put in by the founding fathers.
